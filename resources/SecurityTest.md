# Software Testing

## Security Testing

Security testing ensures that the application is protected against threats like unauthorized access, data breaches, and vulnerabilities that could compromise the systemâ€™s integrity. It covers the following core areas:

### 1. Testing User Requirements
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users can access the system or certain features.
- **User Authentication**: Verify that login mechanisms are secure (e.g., use of multi-factor authentication, strong password policies).
- **Session Management**: Validate session expiration and secure session handling to prevent hijacking.

### 2. Testing Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
- **Confidentiality**: Ensure that sensitive data (user data, transaction info) is encrypted and only accessible to authorized entities.
- **Integrity**: Check that data cannot be altered by unauthorized parties during storage or transmission.
- **Availability**: Ensure the application can handle denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and maintain availability for legitimate users.
- **Performance Under Attack**: Validate that the system maintains performance and stability when under security-related stress.

### 3. Testing Database Structures
- **Secure Database Connections**: Ensure that all communications between the frontend and backend are encrypted (e.g., TLS/SSL).
- **API Key Management**: Verify that API keys and sensitive credentials are not hardcoded or exposed in public repositories, and ensure the use of `.gitignore` for proper key management.
- **Data Injection Protection**: Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by validating input sanitization and parameterized queries.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure sensitive data in the database (e.g., passwords, personal info) is encrypted at rest and during transmission.

### 4. Testing User Interface (UI)
- **Secure Login Mechanisms**: Ensure login pages use HTTPS and that login data (e.g., passwords) is encrypted in transit and hashed securely in storage.
- **Password Storage**: Validate that passwords are hashed with strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2) and are salted.
- **Input Validation**: Ensure that forms and input fields are sanitized to prevent XSS, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and injection attacks.
- **User Feedback**: Ensure that error messages are generic and do not expose sensitive details (e.g., specific errors about login failures).

### 5. Hashing Functions
- **Secure Hashing**: Implement and test hashing algorithms for sensitive data like passwords (e.g., SHA-256 or bcrypt).
- **Hash Table Implementation**: If the application uses hashing for data indexing (e.g., in caches), ensure hash collisions are handled securely.
- **Digital Signatures**: Use hashing algorithms in combination with cryptographic techniques to verify the integrity of messages or data.

### 6. Vulnerability Management
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks on the application to identify potential security gaps or vulnerabilities.
- **Security Audits**: Regularly review code for vulnerabilities and ensure that third-party libraries and dependencies are up to date.
- **Data Leakage Prevention**: Use static analysis tools to ensure that sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) is not accidentally exposed in logs or error messages.

### 7. Compliance and Standards
- **Compliance Checks**: Ensure the application meets industry security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
- **Security Best Practices**: Follow secure coding practices and frameworks like OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) to prevent common vulnerabilities.
