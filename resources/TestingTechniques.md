# Testing Strategies

## Abstract

This paper introduces various software testing methodologies. Much of the code is from external researchers, with some authored by myself. The document was written in PyCharm using markdown and rendered using [md2pdf](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/).

## 1. Automation Testing

### A. Introduction
Automation testing utilizes scripts to continuously and automatically test software systems, recording the results for analysis.

### B. Examples
1. **PyAutoGUI**: Used for automating UI testing.
2. **Selenium & Beautiful Soup**: Automate web scraping tasks that also serve UI testing by finding and interacting with specific elements on a web page.
3. **Selenium & Unittest**: Automating test cases using Python’s unittest framework and Selenium for web-based UI testing.

#### Sample Selenium Script
```python
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By


class HomePageTest(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUp(inst):
        inst.driver = webdriver.Firefox()
        inst.driver.get("http://www.google.com/")

    def test_search_box(self):
        self.assertTrue(self.is_element_present(By.NAME, "q"))

    def is_element_present(self, how, what):
        try: self.driver.find_element(by=how, value=what)
        except NoSuchElementException: return False
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### C. Advantages
- Reliable, repeatable, and reduces human error.
- Cost-efficient and reusable across development stages.

### D. Disadvantages
- Requires proficiency in scripting.
- Test maintenance can be costly when UI changes frequently.

### E. Applications
Automation testing can be applied across embedded systems, web apps, and desktop applications. It is ideal for integration testing and regression testing.

## 2. Data Flow Testing

### A. Introduction
Data Flow Testing tracks the flow of data within an application, focusing on variable declarations and their usage in the code.

### B. Example
Using Python's `pycfg` for control flow analysis:
```bash
$ pip install pycfg, argparse, tkinter, PIL
```

### C. Advantages
- Detects unused or undefined variables.
- Helps prevent crashes by focusing on program logic.

### D. Disadvantages
- Time-consuming and requires programming expertise.

---

## 3. Model-Based Testing

### A. Introduction
Model-Based Testing (MBT) involves generating test procedures automatically from models, helping teams identify requirement inconsistencies early.

### B. Example
Modeling a chat system:
```csharp
action void LogonRequest(int user);
action event void LogonResponse(int user);
```

### C. Advantages
- Early detection of design errors.
- Low maintenance cost once the testable model is complete.

### D. Disadvantages
- Requires a learning curve and infrastructure setup for large-scale tests.

---

## 4. Mutation Testing

### A. Introduction
Mutation testing alters small parts of the source code to test for redundancies or ambiguities in unit tests.

### B. Example
Using Python's `mutmut` package:
```bash
$ mutmut run
```

### C. Advantages
- Identifies weak spots in the code.
- Ensures robust error detection.

### D. Disadvantages
- Time-consuming and not suitable for black-box testing.

---

## 5. UI Testing

### A. Introduction
UI testing ensures the graphical user interface (GUI) meets functional and non-functional requirements.

### B. Example
Automating UI tests with PyAutoGUI for regression testing:
```python
import pyautogui as gui
gui.typewrite('Firefox', interval=0.25)
```

### C. Advantages
- Validates that the UI functions as expected.
- Ensures consistency across design elements.

### D. Disadvantages
- Can be costly and time-consuming due to UX tests involving human feedback.

---

## 6. Integration Testing

### A. Introduction
Integration testing verifies that individual software modules work together as expected.

### B. Example
Testing a web app’s database, backend, and API integration.

### C. Advantages
- Ensures seamless integration of modules.
- Validates data integrity between modules.

### D. Disadvantages
- Requires test data preparation and an established environment, increasing cost and complexity.

---

## 7. Grammar-Based Testing

### A. Introduction
Grammar-based testing uses context-free grammars (CFG) to generate structured test cases for applications like parsers, compilers, and interpreters.

### B. Example
Using `GramTest` for grammar-based test case generation:
```bash
<coursecode> ::= <acadunit> <coursenumber>
```

### C. Advantages
- Automates structured input generation for complex applications.

### D. Disadvantages
- Requires a deep understanding of grammar rules and modeling.

---

## 8. Regression Testing

### A. Introduction
Regression testing ensures that new code changes do not break the existing functionality of the software.

### B. Example
Running previous test cases after updates using Python’s `unittest` framework.

### C. Advantages
- Ensures smooth operation after updates.

### D. Disadvantages
- Can be time-consuming and costly.

---

## 9. Stress Testing

### A. Introduction
Stress testing evaluates the software’s stability under extreme conditions, identifying bottlenecks or failure points.

### B. Example
Stress testing an e-commerce application with simulated high traffic.

### C. Advantages
- Measures system robustness and recovery under load.

### D. Disadvantages
- Requires knowledge and resources to simulate high loads effectively.

---

## 10. Performance Testing

### A. Introduction
Performance testing assesses how a system handles varying levels of workload, focusing on scalability and resource utilization.

### B. Example
Using `locustio` for Python-based performance testing:
```bash
$ pip install locustio
```

### C. Advantages
- Ensures the system performs under different workload conditions.

### D. Disadvantages
- May be expensive and resource-intensive to carry out effectively.
